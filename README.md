# swizzler (for Unity)

A special importer to merge different texture channels into a final texture output.

Implemented as a ScriptableImporter so you don't have to "bake" the image once â€“ feel free to tweak the settings and keep your source textures in their original format.

Also features an experimental importer that will create PBR materials and terrain layers from a set of texture images.

# Usage

### Packing Arbitrary Channels

- Go to Tools > Swizzler > Create Map
  - This will create a file called "New Map.swizzlermap" in the currently selected folder
- Open the map file in the inspector
- Select source textures and channels
- Press "Apply"
- The map file will now be a valid asset that can be used as a texture

### Creating PBR Materials

(experimental, currently HDRP only but should be easy to add support for other render pipelines all at the same time)

- Navigate in your project to a folder containing PBR material textures
- Go to Tools > Swizzler > Create PBR Material
  - This will look at the files in your folder and try to guess which ones are which, and repack them into a Unity mask map
- Ensure the materials were auto-selected correctly and make any changes
- The .swizzlerpbr asset will contain an HDRP material, mask map, and a terrain layer inside it, which can be used normally like any other asset
  - If you would like to customize the material, simply create a material variant of the imported asset.
